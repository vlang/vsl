# Geometry algorithms and structures

This package provides some functions to help with the solution of geometry problems.
It also includes some routines loosely related with geometry.

## Examples

You can find comprehensive examples demonstrating the geometry module features in the main examples directory:

- [`gm_basic_geometry`](../examples/gm_basic_geometry/) - Fundamental 3D geometry operations
- [`gm_advanced_analysis`](../examples/gm_advanced_analysis/) - Advanced geometric analysis techniques  
- [`gm_distance_analysis`](../examples/gm_distance_analysis/) - Distance calculation and shape analysis
- [`gm_spatial_binning`](../examples/gm_spatial_binning/) - Spatial indexing and binning systems
- [`gm_geometry_playground`](../examples/gm_geometry_playground/) - Interactive geometry exploration
- [`gm_trajectory_simulation`](../examples/gm_trajectory_simulation/) - Motion and trajectory analysis

Each example includes a complete `main.v` file and detailed `README.md` with mathematical explanations.
