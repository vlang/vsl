## üöÄ Running the Example

```sh
# Navigate to this directory
cd examples/vcl_opencl_basic

# Compile with OpenCL support
v -cflags -lOpenCL run main.v

# Alternative for some systems
v -cflags "-framework OpenCL" run main.v  # macOS
```

## üìä Expected Output

The example will display:

```text

## üîç OpenCL Concepts Explained

### Platform and Device Model

- **Platform**: OpenCL implementation (NVIDIA, AMD, Intel)
- **Device**: Compute unit (GPU, CPU, FPGA)
- **Context**: Environment for kernels and memory objects
- **Command Queue**: Manages kernel execution order

### Memory Hierarchy

- **Global Memory**: Large, accessible by all work-items
- **Local Memory**: Fast, shared within work-groups
- **Private Memory**: Fastest, per work-item storage

### Execution Model

- **Work-item**: Single execution thread
- **Work-group**: Collection of work-items
- **NDRange**: Complete problem space

## üé® Experiment Ideas

Try modifying the example to:

- **Change data sizes** to test performance scaling
- **Implement different algorithms** (matrix multiplication, image processing)
- **Compare GPU vs CPU performance** for various workloads
- **Use local memory** for optimization
- **Add multiple kernels** for complex computations
