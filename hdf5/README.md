# HDF5

The functions described in this chapter will read or write data to
a file in the [HDF5](https://hdfgroup.org) format.  These contain
`datasets` together with a set of `attributes` for each dataset.

Datasets are arranged in a heirarchical name space similar to Unix
file system.  Each namespace is called a `group`.  Datasets are
stored in a group in an area of the file called a `dataspace`.

This library simplifies much of this and supports:

- Datasets consisting of a vector ([]i64, []f64, etc).
- Datasets consisting of a 2-d array ([][]u8, [][]i16, etc).
- Datasets consisting of a 3-d array ([][][]u32, [][][]f32, etc).
- Any number of attributes for each dataset (int, []f64, string, etc).
  Attributes can be scalars or vectors. These are often metadata
  of the dataset describing how it was acquired or created.

Currently we do not support:

- Writing to groups other than "/" (which is the default)
- Datasets of arrays of strings.
- Compound data structures (akin to `struct`).
- Images or tables.
- Compression.
- Distributed datasets (pointers to other HDF5 files).
- Parallel reading or writing.

The functions described in this chapter are declared in the module `vsl.hdf5`

## ToDo List

Fixing the error processing arrangement, which is currently a mix of
option and result types.

Fix the memory consumption for writing 2-d or 3-d arrays: currently this uses
the flatten() function which is a copy operation.

Add more examples.

Add more datatypes, especially images.

Consider adding a file open-for-update function.

Add automatic group paths.

## Usage example

```v
import vsl.hdf5
import math.stats
import rand

fn main() {
	mut linedata := []f64{len: 21}
	mut meanv := 0.0
	hdffile := 'hdffile.h5'

	for i in 0 .. linedata.len {
		linedata[i] = rand.f64()
	}
	meanv = stats.mean(linedata)

	f := hdf5.new_file(hdffile)?
	f.write_dataset1d('/randdata', linedata)?
	f.write_attribute('/randdata', c'mean', meanv)?
	f.close()
}
```

You can view the result with `h5dump hdffile.h5`.
