# VSL Machine Learning (vsl.ml)

VSL aims to provide a robust set of tools for scientific computing with an emphasis
on performance and ease of use. In the `vsl.ml` module, some machine learning
models are designed as observers of data, meaning they re-train automatically when
data changes, while others do not require this functionality.

## Key Features

- **Observers of Data**: Some machine learning models in VSL act as observers,
  re-training automatically when data changes.
- **High Performance**: Leverages Vâ€™s performance optimizations and can integrate
  with C and Fortran libraries like Open BLAS and LAPACK.
- **Versatile Algorithms**: Supports a variety of machine learning algorithms and
  models.

## Usage

### Loading Data

The `Data` struct in `vsl.ml` is designed to hold data in matrix format for machine
learning tasks. Here's a brief overview of how to use it:

#### Creating a Data Object

You can create a `Data` object using the following methods:

- `Data.new`: Creates a new `Data` object with specified dimensions.
- `Data.from_raw_x`: Creates a `Data` object from raw x values (without y values).
- `Data.from_raw_xy`: Creates a `Data` object from raw x and y values combined in a single matrix.
- `Data.from_raw_xy_sep`: Creates a `Data` object from separate x and y raw values.

### Data Methods

The `Data` struct has several key methods to manage and manipulate data:

- `set(x, y)`: Sets the x matrix and y vector and notifies observers.
- `set_y(y)`: Sets the y vector and notifies observers.
- `set_x(x)`: Sets the x matrix and notifies observers.
- `split(ratio)`: Splits the data into two parts based on the given ratio.
- `clone()`: Returns a deep copy of the Data object without observers.
- `clone_with_same_x()`: Returns a deep copy of the Data object but shares the same x reference.
- `add_observer(obs)`: Adds an observer to the data object.
- `notify_update()`: Notifies observers of data changes.

### Stat Observer

The `Stat` struct is an observer of `Data`, providing statistical analysis of the
data it observes. It automatically updates its statistics when the underlying data
changes.

## Observer Models

The following machine learning models in VSL are compatible with the `Observer`
pattern. This means they can observe data changes and automatically update
themselves.

### K-Means Clustering

K-Means Clustering is used for unsupervised learning to group data points into
clusters. As an observer model, it re-trains automatically when the data changes,
which is useful for dynamic datasets that require continuous updates.

### K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)

K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) is used for classification tasks where the target
variable is categorical. As an observer model, it re-trains automatically when the
data changes, which is beneficial for datasets that are frequently updated.

## Non-Observer Models

The following machine learning models in VSL do not require the observer pattern
and are trained once on a dataset without continuous updates.

### Linear Regression

Linear Regression is used for predicting a continuous target variable based on one
or more predictor variables. It is typically trained once on a dataset and used to
make predictions without requiring continuous updates. Hence, it is not implemented
as an observer model.
